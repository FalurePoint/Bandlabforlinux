# Bandlabforlinux
A client for the Bandlab web studio sorftware.

This is not officaly suported by bandlab at all for all bux reports please contact me not BandLab at ECRdev@protonmail.com.

DISCLAMER: if an official bandlab client is releast this will be taken off the app stores.

This repo contains the source code for the bandlabforlinux app for, well, Linux!
it will also hopefully contain soon is:
  1. A webpage for the project.
  2. Downloadable installers for Linux and Linux ARM.
  3. Beter documentation.
  4. Other contributers that are more skilled in the programming arts then me.
  5. Beta and Stable releases.
  
What to never expect from this project:
  1. A deticated and profesional developer. sorry but I just do way to much to be that for anyone and on top of all that i still have school to finish.
  2. Officail support from BandLab.
  3. Someone who knows what they are doing.
  4. free cookies. (Don't ask)
  
how to use for those that dont already know:
  1. Stop and realize that if you dont alredy know how to use source code you probably should not be trying to.
  2. Download the entire dirctory in the way that you see fit.
  3. Run or compile bandlabforlinux.py how you want.
  4. Note that  files with the .tdf extention are formatted as plaintext but the extention has been changed for ease of use to .tdf or .Terminal Data File
  5. this is libe to be an out of date guide soon as i will probably be doing some work on my new file format structure and will becrwating a read/write script to handle it instead and be adding support to it to contain copressed scrips as well as data in a secure format using incription.
